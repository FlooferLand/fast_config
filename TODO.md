# TO DO!

## High priority
1. [ ] Implement an optional feature to use [dirs](https://lib.rs/crates/dirs), allowing users to directly store their config files in `~/.config/` on Linux for example
2. [ ] Add in a `from_string` method and an `empty` constructor
3. [ ] Make JSON, TOML, and YAML keep comments after being written to.

## General
- [ ] Attempt to compress TOML, and YAML when pretty is turned off.
